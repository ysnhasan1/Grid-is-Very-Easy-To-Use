# Grid-is-very-easy-to-use.
### Using Grid in complex structures is the right decision.

In this project, I created a random Mondrian Art that I chose in CSS Grid. 
When you look at the image, it may seem very complex at first. Maybe you're confused. 
Believe me, that's what I thought before I learned about Grid. 
But it is very easy to create this great 2D layout using Grid. 

### ***Layout That I Created***

You can see below that I obtain the same target image. 
Notice that I simply chose yellow, red, blue, and white for the grid items.
